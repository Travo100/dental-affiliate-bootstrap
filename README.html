<li>Shortcode [listposts num=&quot;3&quot; cat=&quot;1&quot;] has been added. The shortcode displays the number of posts by its respective category.</li>
<li>Theme options have been added along with dynamic content.</li>
<li>Any wordpress gallery now opens its thumbnails in the blueimp lightbox.</li>
<li>FitText.js, Retina.js added and can be used at your disposal. </li>
<li>Current issue where if shortcode is used on any child pages it takes away its page ID number. You can still style that page by 
using .page-id as your class. </li>
</ul>
<p>Using Dynamic Content Generator:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to functions.php</li>
<li>See the example given in the theme. You use associative arrays to create seperated content.</li>
<li>To call the content into your theme simply place it into any .php file 
 Ex: &lt;?php get_dyn_content(&quot;home&quot;, &quot;title&quot;); ?&gt;</li>
</ol>
<p>Creating a page with sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>In WordPress create a Home page.</li>
<li>Create a seperate page in WordPress and make its parent the Home page.</li>
<li>To style the page you just created look up its page ID by viewing the source or using the web inspector tool.</li>
<li>You can see the page id in the body class Ex.&quot;page-id-23&quot;</li>
<li>Go into your CSS file and simply called .page-id-23 and style how you would like. </li>
</ol>
